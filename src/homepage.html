    <p>At “Capture the Adventure”, we don’t just go on vacations, we create memorable adventures for  years to come and also share our explorations with a like-minded community. 
    “Capture the Adventure” has been around for over 50 years, and we started as a small group of hikers who loved to capture amazing wildlife and landscape photos while camping or backpacking off-the-beaten paths. Our unique adventures as a group of friends inspired us to create a community of like-minded individuals who also enjoyed nature through the lens and wanted to create a larger experience for beginners to get started in the outdoor world.</p>
